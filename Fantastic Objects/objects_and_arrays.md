#### A piece of theory

Well, i told myself to be the most objective(sry for the pun) as possible with this repo and don't write theorical about anything, but we need a concept to build this topic and make everything uniform.

To this point we know variables, types of values, operators, conditionals and loops, we kinda know the basic of the basic. But **Javascript** as simple as it is, wasn't built to do the basic of the basic. **JS** is a *Object Oriented Programming Language*, which means that **every single thing** in Javascript is related to a Object, even the ambient where it's running.
<div align="center"><i>But what in the sake of the holy duck is a Object?</i></div>
&nbsp;

The most simple definition of a Object in programming(that i can think right now) is: 
<div align="center"><i>"A way to represent real life stuff with code"</i></div>
&nbsp;

A Object in **Javascript** is an abstract way to represent real life objects, which by themselves can contain it's own properties, methods and even another objects. 

Let's say we create the object *Human*. It has properties like *weight*, *height*, *nationality*, et cetera. It has methods, our *Human* can *Run*, *Talk*, *Punch someone(it can, but shouldn't)*, *Eat*, and a lot of things that we say that our *Human* can do. And it can have it's own Object too, for example, the Object *Hand*, which has the properties *Fingers*; Maybe our *Human* can have a Object *Dog*, that also has it's properties similar to our *Human*. See? It's kinda easy to understand.
<div align="center"><i>Nice, but what about the Arrays?</i></div>
&nbsp;
Arrays are a collection of data, a way to store organized data that can be accessed by an index.
