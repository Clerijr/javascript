# So...

Right now i found myself with a series of doubts and mental blockades. I'm probably at that time as a newbie developer who doesn't know clearly where to go or what to do to improve. Today we got a **LOT** of programming languages and a **LOT** of frameworks/libraries, it's like an mmorpg where i got trough a simple tutorial and reach a sea of things to do, in a ocean of how to do those things.

So right now i need to improve by choosing a language or a stack and learn that until i feel comfortable to do what i need to do. 

And the chosen language was **Javascript**!

I use **Js** and **Json** at my job and i got a lack of technical knowledge about everything, so i was thinking about synthetize whatever i know about this language and learn something while building this repo, because one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it!

So, let's go, thats gonna be a repository for newbies, showing some simple and straight trough information about **Javascript**. But remember, i'm doing this for study, destinated to myself in the future (*hello future Clerijr!*), so if i write something wrong or deprecated, please correct me.

To make it all simple i intend to build a repo with a pyramid structure, with the basics(variables, loops, operators...) at the bottom and getting more complex at the peak, don't know yet what exactly will be the ending topic, but something with **NodeJs** probably.

Remember, *present Clerijr*, focus in this project to the end!
